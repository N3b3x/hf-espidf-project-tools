# ðŸ”¬ Advanced Topics

Advanced features and technical deep-dives for power users and complex development scenarios.

## Available Topics

- **[Multi-Version ESP-IDF](advanced/multi-version-idf/)** - Support for multiple ESP-IDF versions
- **[Port Detection](advanced/port-detection/)** - Cross-platform device identification
- **[Utility Scripts](advanced/utility-scripts/)** - Development automation tools

## When to Use Advanced Features

These topics are recommended for:

- **Multi-version projects** requiring different ESP-IDF versions
- **Cross-platform development** with automatic device detection
- **Automated workflows** with utility scripts
- **Complex CI/CD pipelines** with advanced configuration

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics, ensure you're familiar with:

- [Getting Started](getting-started/) - Basic setup and configuration
- [Core Systems](core-systems/) - Fundamental development systems
- [Configuration System](configuration/) - YAML configuration management

## Integration

Advanced features build upon the core systems and can be integrated into existing workflows without disrupting basic functionality.
