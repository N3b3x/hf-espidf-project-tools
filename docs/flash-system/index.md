# ESP32 Flash System

The ESP32 flash system provides comprehensive firmware deployment, device monitoring, and development workflow management for ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Core Features

- **Intelligent Port Detection**: Automatic ESP32 device identification across platforms
- **Operation-First Syntax**: Intuitive command structure for better usability
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in logging system with automatic rotation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent behavior on Linux and macOS
- **Error Prevention**: Validation and error handling with clear troubleshooting guidance

## Key Capabilities

- Automatic ESP32 device detection and port identification
- Firmware flashing with validation and error checking
- Real-time device monitoring and debugging
- Integrated logging and log management
- Port connectivity testing and troubleshooting
- Cross-platform serial port management

## Quick Start

### Basic Flash Operations

```bash
## Flash and monitor (recommended)
./flash_app.sh flash_monitor gpio_test Release --log

## Flash only (production)
./flash_app.sh flash gpio_test Release --log

## Monitor existing firmware
./flash_app.sh monitor --log

## Analyze firmware size
./flash_app.sh size gpio_test Release
```

### Port Detection

```bash
## List available ports
./detect_ports.sh

## Test port connectivity
./detect_ports.sh --test-connection

## Show detailed port information
./detect_ports.sh --verbose
```

### Log Management

```bash
## List all logs
./manage_logs.sh list

## Search for errors
./manage_logs.sh search "ERROR"

## Show latest log
./manage_logs.sh latest
```
