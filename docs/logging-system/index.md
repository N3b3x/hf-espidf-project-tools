# ESP32 Logging System

The ESP32 logging system provides comprehensive log capture, management, and analysis capabilities for all ESP32 development operations, ensuring complete documentation and traceability of build, flash, and monitor activities.

## Core Features

- **Automatic Log Generation**: Built-in logging for all script operations
- **Intelligent Organization**: Structured log file naming and organization
- **Comprehensive Capture**: Complete capture of build, flash, and monitor output
- **Advanced Search**: Cross-log search and pattern matching capabilities
- **Automatic Rotation**: Smart log management with configurable retention

## Key Capabilities

- Automatic log file creation with timestamped naming
- Cross-log search and pattern matching
- Log statistics and analysis tools
- Automatic log rotation and cleanup
- Integration with all ESP32 development scripts
- Professional log formatting and organization

## Quick Start

### Basic Log Generation

```bash
## Generate logs for build operations
./build_app.sh gpio_test Release --log

## Generate logs for flash operations
./flash_app.sh flash gpio_test Release --log

## Generate logs for monitor sessions
./flash_app.sh monitor --log

## Generate logs for size analysis
./flash_app.sh size gpio_test Release --log
```

### Log Management

```bash
## List all logs
./manage_logs.sh list

## Show latest log
./manage_logs.sh latest

## Search for errors
./manage_logs.sh search "ERROR"

## Show log statistics
./manage_logs.sh stats
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
## Search for specific patterns
./manage_logs.sh search "ERROR" --type flash
./manage_logs.sh search "WARNING" --app gpio_test

## Analyze error patterns
./manage_logs.sh analyze-errors --days 7

## Generate reports
./manage_logs.sh report --days 30 --output report.html
```

## Integration

The logging system integrates seamlessly with:

- **Build System**: Automatic capture of build operations and output
- **Flash System**: Comprehensive logging of flash operations and device communication
- **Monitor System**: Real-time capture of device output and debugging information
- **Configuration System**: Logging of configuration loading and validation
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated logging for continuous integration workflows

## Log Organization

Logs are automatically organized by operation type:

```
logs/
├── build/                    # Build operation logs
├── flash/                    # Flash operation logs
├── monitor/                  # Monitor session logs
├── size/                     # Size analysis logs
└── archive/                  # Archived logs
```

## Best Practices

- Always use logging for debugging and troubleshooting
- Use descriptive log names for better organization
- Regularly analyze logs for patterns and issues
- Implement automated log cleanup and rotation
- Monitor log storage usage and performance
